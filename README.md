# 🌀WHIRLPOOL🌀

## Overview

Whirlpool is a 3D Action First-Person Shooter where the player controls a character in an underwater world where they have to fight their way through levels filled with fishy foes.

## Core Gameplay

## Game Type

Action FPS.

## Player Setup

In single player, you control the main character in a first-person view.

In online multiplayer, each player controls their own character and they fight amongst themselves.

## AI Design

## Scripted Events

Certain areas will be blocked off via collectable keys or enemy arenas, which would force the player to progress through specific segments before gaining additional access in the environment.

The end of the level will have a major boss, which, when defeated, which either immediately end the game or unlock access to an object which ends the game when interacted with.

Upon completing the game, the player’s playtime is displayed and, if it’s fast enough, saved as their “best time.”


## Environment

The environment would be meant to resemble an underwater temple, which is segmented off into different rooms and areas.

There will be an attempt to create the models necessary to build the environment ourselves, but for more complicated objects (and enemies) free-to-use assets or 2D sprites mapped to a 3D object will be employed instead.

## Physics Scope

The physics, at least in concept, will have somewhat of a floaty feeling to mimic the sensation of being underwater. To what extent this will play out is currently undecided, as the game still needs to be responsive and easy to move around in.

This is more of a flourish than a required element, however. If there is not time to implement this in a way that feels nice, more traditional FPS physics will be used instead.

## FSM Scope

## Systems and Mechanics

The major systems at play are as follows:

Attacking with your (presumably ranged) weapon, and the collision of those attacks.

Enemies that can move, attack and deal damage at specific (or random) intervals, and be killed by the player.

The collection of items that can either benefit the player (such as healing their health) or unlock access to additional areas.

Areas of the map that gate progression behind beating a specific subset of the game’s total enemies.

The recording of the player’s completion time, as well as a points system based on items collected and total enemies beaten.
